# Spam-Detection from scratch
SMS Spam detection using logistic regression.
In this project I've applied text data preprocessing techniques and tf-idf statistic from scratch to develop a spam classifier.
The dataset used was from https://www.kaggle.com/c/spam-detection/data. F1 score range for logistic regression is 0.92-0.94 on 
cross validation.
